**Note :** Words partially written or with small misspellings will be understood by the game. Capital letters are not taken into account.

## Characteristics:
- Two difficulty modes are available and result in different maps and faster skill tests,
- Map and information are displayed in the terminal and the player represented by a star,
- Player has two lives,
- To win you need to repair 3 generators and exit from the exit room,
- A generator is repaired in several times unless you have a tool box (it's instant),
- Recoverable items are for single use and only one can be taken at a time,
- By using the medkit, you earn a life,
- If you are in the same room as the killer, a skill test starts (calculation or writing a letter). If you succeed, you dodge the hit else you lose a life,
- The presence of a generator or object in a room is indicated next to the room name in brackets.

**Note :** Some values such as the number of lives, skill tests, the number of items, of generators can be modified in the "customPreset.txt" file. Don't modify the values in "defaultPreset.txt" file.

> Your statistics are also available in "saveData.txt" file. You can delete the old one (his creation is automatic).
